                    <p style="text-align:justify">The city's official date of establishment is 988 A.D., although
                        evidence of its existence dates
                        back
                        to the
                        second century, when it was known as Eblana. The first settlers were Norman Vikings. Dublin
                        remained
                        a small
                        medieval town until the middle of the 17th century. After the English Civil Wars, the town was
                        taken
                        over by
                        Oliver Cromwell. It only had a population of 9,000 but over the next century, Dublin grew in
                        size
                        and
                        wealth, becoming the second city of the British Empire.
                        However, the Act of Union between England and Ireland in 1800 abolished the Irish Parliament and
                        set
                        in
                        motion a long decline that did not stop until Ireland became independent in 1922, which came
                        about
                        after the
                        1916 Rising, the War of Independence and the revolution of 1919 to 1921, which led to the
                        establishment of
                        the Irish Free State. Dublin, which had seen some of the most violent clashes during the
                        struggle
                        for
                        autonomy, became the political, economic, and cultural centre of Ireland.</p>

                    <p>Supermac’s is the Irish equivalent of the American fast food restaurants, offering a combination
                        of
                        the burger joint, pizzeria, fried chicken restaurant, ice cream parlour and sandwich and coffee

                    <p>The American influenced Irish franchise, Eddie Rocket’s City Diner is worth a visit. A little
                        more
                        expensive than Burger King or McDonald’s or Burger King, but it’s a classier environment and the
                        food is tasty. </p>

                        inexpensive, authentic and delicious. The seating area may feel a little cramped and busy.</p>
                    <p>People tend to eat and go, rather than linger. Low cost high volume is what the owners aim for,

                        pub-crawlers and nightclubbers. Not the cheapest, but probably the best place to eat a freshly
                        cooked kebab!</p>
                    <p>Medina Street Food Co. is probably the best value Indian subcontinent restaurant in Dublin,
                        offering
                        traditional vegetarian and Indian curries, in an informal alcohol free setting!</p>

                    <p>The Foggy Dew is a popular bar but always seems a little too loud and a bit packed. Located
                        around
                        Temple Bar.</p>

                    <p>The Long Stone is just beside Trinity College, full of students and locals. Good for a few pints,

                    <p>The Oliver St. John Gogarty markets itself to tourists as a traditional Irish bar, offering Irish

                    <p>The Odeon used to be a railway station. Opens till late. Moderately priced compared to Temple Bar
                        pubs. Located on Harcourt Street.</p>
                    <p>Dakota is a sophisticated bar located on South William Street. Great for an afternoon or evening
                        drink.</p>
                    <p>Cafe en Seine has beautiful décor that nicely complements the beautiful crowd. Cool place to hang

                        largest

                        an
                        aspirational feel about them. You may not be able to afford the goods but it’s fun window
                        shopping.
                        There are plenty of swanky cafes and restaurants nearby.</p>
                    <p> O'Connell Street is the main thoroughfare in Dublin city. Famous for the Spire of Dublin and the
                        General Post Office building, the streets off the main thoroughfare are also of interest to
                        shoppers. Henry Street and Talbot Street contain the usual High Street shops and lead to the
                        Jervis
                        and Ilac shopping centres.</p>
