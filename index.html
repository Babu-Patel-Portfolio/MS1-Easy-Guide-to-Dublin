    <div class="jumbotron text-center">
        <h1>Eat</h1>
        <p>Dublin offers offers a wide range of food with many restaurants offering lunchtime and early evening set
            menus. Have a leisurely walk around and make your choice. Here are a few of my personal favourites.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-4">
                <h3>Fast Food</h3>
                <p>Supermac’s is the Irish equivalent of the American fast food restaurants, offering a combination of
                    the burger joint, pizzeria, fried chicken restaurant, ice cream parlour and sandwich and coffee shop
                    .</p>
                <p>The American influenced Irish franchise, Eddie Rocket’s City Diner is worth a visit. A little more
                    expensive than Burger King or McDonald’s or Burger King, but it’s a classier environment and the
                    food is tasty. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
                <h3>Buffets</h3>
                <p>The Moore Street Mall a less than glamorous location but its foodhall is a real find. The food is
                    inexpensive, authentic and delicious. The seating area may feel a little cramped and busy.</p>
                <p>People tend to eat and go, rather than linger. Low cost high volume is what the owners aim for,
                    offering Brazilian, Indian, Pakistani and Chinese cuisine.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
                <h3>Restaurants</h3>
                <p>Zaytoon Persian Restaurant is in the heart of touristic Temple Bar and is frequented by tourists,
                    pub-crawlers and nightclubbers. Not the cheapest, but probably the best place to eat a freshly
                    cooked kebab!</p>
                <p>Medina Street Food Co. is probably the best value Indian subcontinent restaurant in Dublin, offering
                    traditional vegetarian and Indian curries, in an informal alcohol free setting!</p>
            </div>

    <!-- Drink Section-->

    <div class="jumbotron text-center">
        <h1>Drink</h1>
        <p>Dublin is famous for its nightlife and pubs. Whatever the occasion or taste, there will be a pub to suit your
            needs. Pubs to sit in and have a pint and a chat or traditional Irish food and entertainment. There are far
            too many to mention, but here are a few to give you an idea of what’s on offer.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-4">
                <h3>Traditional Pubs</h3>
                <p>The Foggy Dew is a popular bar but always seems a little too loud and a bit packed. Located around
                    Temple Bar.</p>
                <p>Doyles is a wonderfully quaint pub, ideal for a quiet pint on a leisurely afternoon. Located on
                    College Green.</p>
                <p>The Long Stone is just beside Trinity College, full of students and locals. Good for a few pints,
                    though you may struggle to find a seat. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
                <h3>Tourist Pubs</h3>
                <p>Fitzsimons is a good place to watch the football and have a few drinks. Live music nights.
                    Located on Eustace St in Temple Bar.</p>
                <p>The Oliver St. John Gogarty markets itself to tourists as a traditional Irish bar, offering Irish
                    music, food and drink.</p>
                <p>The Auld Dubliner offers Traditional Irish Music performances. Say no more. Located at 17 Anglesea
                    Street, Temple Bar.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
                <h3>Modern Pubs</h3>
                <p>The Odeon used to be a railway station. Opens till late. Moderately priced compared to Temple Bar
                    pubs. Located on Harcourt Street.</p>
                <p>Dakota is a sophisticated bar located on South William Street. Great for an afternoon or evening
                    drink.</p>
                <p>Cafe en Seine has beautiful décor that nicely complements the beautiful crowd. Cool place to hang
                    out. Located on Dawson Street.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Shop Section-->

    <div class="jumbotron text-center">
        <h1>Shop</h1>
        <p>Dublin does offer a lot of shopping alternatives, though goods here are expensive when compared to north of
            the border and the rest of the UK. Favourable exchange rate between the euro and the pound have helped and
            there are regular sales and special offers.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-4">
                <h3>Centres</h3>
                <p>The Jervis Shopping Centre is on the northside, on Henry Street and Jervis Street and is the largest
                    shopping centre in the city-centre with two floors of shops and one dedicated to a restaurant area.
                </p>
                <p>The Ilac Shopping Centre is also on Henry Street and is the oldest shopping centre in the
                    city-centre.</p>
                <p>Stephens Green Shopping Centre is on the southside at the top of Grafton Street and across from
                    Stephens Green. It is one of the newer complexes with three floors.
                </p>

            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
                <h3>Streets</h3>
                <p>Grafton Street Probably the nicest place to shop in Dublin. Upmarket shops like Brown Thomas have an
                    aspirational feel about them. You may not be able to afford the goods but it’s fun window shopping.
                    There are plenty of swanky cafes and restaurants nearby.</p>
                <p> O'Connell Street is the main thoroughfare in Dublin city. Famous for the Spire of Dublin and the
                    General Post Office building, the streets off the main thoroughfare are also of interest to
                    shoppers. Henry Street and Talbot Street contain the usual High Street shops and lead to the Jervis
                    and Ilac shopping centres.</p>
