        <h1>Drink</h1>
        <p>Dublin is famous for its nightlife and pubs. Whatever the occasion or taste, there will be a pub to suit your
            needs. Pubs to sit in and have a pint and a chat or traditional Irish food and entertainment. There are far
            too many to mention, but here are a few to give you an idea of what’s on offer.

                <h3>Traditional Pubs</h3>
                <p>The Foggy Dew is a popular bar but always seems a little too loud and a bit packed. Located around
                    Temple Bar.</p>
                <p>Doyles is a wonderfully quaint pub, ideal for a quiet pint. Located on College Green.</p>
                <p>The Long Stone is just beside Trinity College, full of students and locals. Good for a few pints,
                    though you may struggle to find a seat. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
                <h3>Tourist Pubs</h3>
                <p>Fitzsimons is a good place to watch the football and have a few drinks. Live music, on most nights.
                    Located on Eustace St in Temple Bar.</p>
                <p>The Oliver St. John Gogarty markets itself to tourists as a traditional Irish bar, offering Irish

                <h3>Modern Pubs</h3>
                <p>The Odeon used to be a railway station. Opens till late. Moderately priced compared to Temple Bar
                    pubs. Located on Harcourt Street.</p>
                <p>Dakota is a sophisticated bar located on South William Street. Great for an afternoon or evening
                    drink.</p>
                <p>Cafe en Seine has beautiful décor that nicely complements the beautiful crowd. Cool place to hang
