Dublin has become the destination for many people throughout Europe and the rest of the world, to learn English, embark on further education, find a job or make Ireland their home.

This website is intended to be a simple concise guide to Dublin for those who have settled in the city and is designed to be responsive and available on a variety of devices, making it easy to navigate for regular users and visitors alike.

**Strategy**


**User Needs.**

The intention is that the user will access the site primarily on their mobile, tablet and then there desktop. The information is to be presented in a concise manner.


**Technical Aptitudes**

The project will be done using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap 4.6, the framework which relatively new to me. The idea is to structure the page in a way that the user can navigate it easily and find information quickly.


**Business Vision**

The project is not a commercial venture but simply to inform and educate the user the ease at which Dublin can be enjoyed and navigated, providing a simple guide.  Once users have signed up for the newsletters, there are business opportunities available, such as inviting the purchase of more comprehensive guides, such as eBooks. 


**Scope**

The objective is to highlight to new and potential visitors to the city that city is worth visiting and promotes Dublin as a modern vibrant city through imagery and refined look of the site.


**Structure**

The original structure was for a multi-page site but this was abandoned as it would not fit the user needs. Instead, a single page site, split into sections with a navigation bar at the top linking to each section, ending with a social media section where users could find more comprehensive information.
