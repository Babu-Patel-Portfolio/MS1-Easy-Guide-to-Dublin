Dublin has become the destination for many people throughout Europe and the rest of the world, to learn English, embark on further education, find a job or make Ireland their home.

This website is intended to be a simple concise guide to Dublin for those who have settled in the city and is designed to be responsive and available on a variety of devices, making it easy to navigate for regular users and visitors alike.

**Strategy**


**User Needs.**

The intention is that the user will access the site primarily on their mobile, tablet and then there desktop. The information is to be presented in a concise manner.


**Technical Aptitudes**

The project will be done using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap 4.6, the framework which relatively new to me. The idea is to structure the page in a way that the user can navigate it easily and find information quickly.


**Business Vision**

The project is not a commercial venture but simply to inform and educate the user the ease at which Dublin can be enjoyed and navigated, providing a simple guide.  Once users have signed up for the newsletters, there are business opportunities available, such as inviting the purchase of more comprehensive guides, such as eBooks. 


**Scope**

The objective is to highlight to new and potential visitors to the city that city is worth visiting and promotes Dublin as a modern vibrant city through imagery and refined look of the site.


**Structure**

The original structure was for a multi-page site but this was abandoned as it would not fit the user needs. Instead, a single page site, split into sections with a navigation bar at the top linking to each section, ending with a social media section where users could find more comprehensive information. 



**Design**

**Colour Scheme**

The three main colours used on the site are green, white and orange, which represent the colours of the Irish flag. Dublin is the capital of the Republic of Ireland.

The colours are hues rather than the actual colours as I wanted a more refined look to complement the images. I chose a complementary palette with shades of shamrock green and orange.

- Green is used at the beginning on the navigation bar and towards the end to almost &#39;bookend&#39; the site.
- The colour white is used as the foreground text on the &#39;hero image&#39; and the subsequent images on the site.
- Orange is used for the heading on the blocks of text.


- The navigation bar has a colour relating to Shamrock green, and was chosen as it was a less garish introduction than #169B62 , upon testing with the &#39;hero image&#39;.
- Additional colours for the buttons were from Bootstrap and chosen to complement the existing images and colour palette, as well as convey meaning.
